# eRPC Interface

This directory contains the eRPC interface definition and Python generated code for RPC channel used in between IDE and PLC.

## Directory Structure

- `erpc_PLCObject.erpc`: eRPC interface definition, subset of IDL language
- `erpc_PLCObject/`: This directory contains eRPC interface generated python code
- `__init__.py`: Useless and empty file also generated by `erpcgen`


## eRPC Interface Definition

The eRPC interface definition files define the communication protocol and message formats used by the project. These files are used to generate the necessary code for both the client and server sides.

## Generated Code

The Python code generated from the eRPC interface definition provides the necessary functions and classes to interact with the eRPC server. This code is used to implement both sides of the communication.

```sh
erpcgen -g py erpc_PLCObject.erpc
```
